## Motivationâ†’

[Spl token program and token 2022 + compresssed nfts]

The current state of example is contain repos, example-d-app and content about spl token-mint and transfer to another wallet  

## SPl Library

- A collection of on-chain programs that target the Solana Sealevel runtime.
- These programs are tested against Solana's implementation of Sealevel.

## Eth Contracts

In Ethereum, for ERC-20 tokens, each fungible token has its smart contract. For ERC-721 (or ERC-1155), each non-fungible token collection has its own contract.

## Solana program

Just like Ethereum contracts, Solana has [programs](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs). These programs contain executable codes that interpret instructions and send them to each transaction on the chain.

### Acc/ Blocksâ†’

- The program account owns the state storage account, and programs themselves are stateless.
- Accounts collect [rent](https://solana.com/docs/core/rent), which is a term used by validators. Behind the scenes, it involves mathematical calculations.

### Some things about solana program

- Programs are executable accounts.
- Programs can only change the data and debit accounts they own.
- Programs have two types: native and executable. Native programs are built into the core system, while executable programs are custom-made by other devs. Both types run in parallel in the [Sealevel](https://medium.com/solana-labs/sealevel-parallel-processing-thousands-of-smart-contracts-d814b378192) runtime.
- Stateless programs are compiled by SBF and BPF code.
- There are native and on-chain programs.
- Data accounts are used for state storage.
- Program accounts are stateless.
- Executable programs are loaded by the [BPF loader](https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/bpf_loader_upgradeable/index.html) program and are also upgradable after deployment to the network.

## Spl Token programâ†’

A Rust crate(crab) acts as an interface for SPL tokens, working like an ERC-20 token interface.

The crab(rust) crate type is a library, which means it's reusable functionality. Think of it like Lego bricks that fit together to build a package, and we store these in modules.

The [Solana Token Program](https://spl.solana.com/token) is your go-to solution! It's like a magic toolkit that equips you with all the tools necessary to create your own customized tokens and release them on the Solana blockchain.

Here's the exciting part: you don't have to be a coding expert. The Token Program offers both the fundamental code (like a [blueprint](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/program)) and a user-friendly interface. Picture it as a Lego set with easy-to-follow instructions â€“ you can utilize it to craft your own special solana tokens.

This program defines a common implementation for Fungible and Non Fungible tokens.

The Solana Token Program is like a Lego set for making tokens. To  build Solana tokens, you'll need [JS helpers](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/js) or js binding methods and APIs etc...

JS helpers: These are like time-saving mini-tools that handle common tasks for you.

Binding methods: They connect your JavaScript code with the Solana Token Program, making it easy to interact with your tokens.

APIs: These are instructions for telling the program what to do, like creating tokens or transferring ownership.

By engaging with these tools you will level up your token-building skills and let you create even cooler Solana tokens.

Solana provides an [ATA](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account) ([Associated Token Account](https://solidityonsolana.one/CourseContent/module-4/module-4-a/transferspltokens#:~:text=Associated%20Token%20Account.-,Associated%20Token%20Accounts,-ATAs%20offer%20an)) structure for mapping(or can be tracking) token(crypto tokens) accounts(solana lego block), similar to Ethereum's solidity(mapping) structure.

User Wallet address + specific token mint === generate a pda (mapped acc) for a specific token

![ataTopda.jpeg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/521abc81-0300-4b28-afc0-7dbba3b32c10/947f904f-05cf-4019-8331-de55bed422e1/ataTopda.jpeg)

The spl token program crab crates provides functionalities like this 

- It imports modules.
- It has a constant ID for the token program.
- It operating like creating token mints and sending tokens to other wallets etcâ€¦. by crates types methods.

## For Working With Spl token program â†’

SPl token program provides features like Token mint , transfer and burn etcâ€¦.
To work with this, we just need to send instructions to the spl token program.

To do this, we interact with the Solana token program using tools like SPL Token CLI, JS client, and CPI(cross-program invocation) to Crab program(cpi for composability of programs).

We'll use JS client([Dapp-scaffold](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold)) for the frontend and CPI to crab for the backend to work with SPL tokens.

## How to configure systemsâ†’

Blockchain systems run on cryptographically secure numbers.

The solana-anchor-rust backend [[The repo for backend is here](https://github.com/shivamSspirit/S-Sol-tokens/tree/main/spltokens-sol-program)] 
solana d-app-scaffold[[The repo for frontend is here](https://github.com/shivamSspirit/S-Sol-tokens/tree/main/solana-client)] provide us frontend utilities, like how user interact with on chain program (by sending transaction to solana blockchain)

The blockchain program runs on hardware operating systems compiled using Rust language. For client interaction we just use javascript,so, providing browser UI and UX, with helpers-tools across the solana ecosystem.

**Now how to connect with frontend**â†’

[Idl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) (interface description language) is used for connecting deployed on chain solana program with client side Code(UI+UX).

Generally we did not need to manage all configuration

solanaâ€™s anchor frameworks provide us set of tools and features to building around solanaâ€™s d-apps

you can learn about anchor setup and installation [here](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation).

## The composability of d-app architecture:

We use [Solana Web3.js](https://solana.com/docs/clients/javascript) to interact with user interfaces and enhance user experience.

Solana web3 provides us Js helpers methods and Connection object(JS like Object) to interact with solana native deployed smart contract on Solana blockchain

We need a blockchain cluster(block state replication on internet(can be Devnet,Mainnet, Testnet)
you can learn more about Solana clusterâ€™s [here](https://docs.solanalabs.com/clusters).

we will use Devnet.

Or a wallet(user public key(web3 native passport) (can be general keypair , wallet adapter, or filesystem wallet etcâ€¦).

This Create an environment where user(public) can interact with blockchain system  using a new, secure identity in Web3(web3 wallets or public key of user(public)). This involves using wallets and key pairs based on the ed2115 elliptic curve, which provide strong security. It lets you interact on-chain with others securely.

These all are build a cohesive environment for public(let user) to interact with blockchain 
ecosystem.

Now Enough theory , letâ€™s move to d-app

# Mint And Transfer Solana tokens with crab (ðŸ¦€) like environment

!https://i.postimg.cc/vBrFS4hg/artwork1-01.png

## Introduction

This is a basic Quiz-Exapmle of how to mint and transfer Spl Tokens.

## Prerequisites

This is a Solana-D-app scaffold project, so you need to have nodejs installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shivamSspirit/S-Sol-tokens.git
cd spltokens-sol-program
npm i update
npm install

```

## Usage

Build the project:

```bash
anchor build
```

anchor will build the project and update project with the target to deployed program on chain
give us feature to connect with two system backend and client then give a web3 simulation to the user

we will use it later

first deploy the program

for this

run:

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

in parrallel terminal
run this (if you have enough sol on devnet(clusters) to deploye this program on chain)
run:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

you will get a id
this is the program id

```bash
C2eEY8eeediwD2YXvZZGQ74G9kPB5PeRNFGUzSiFadcW
```

for you deployed on chain program
this is metadata address in our idl

copy this id

then paste this id into two files

1. [anchor.toml](https://vscode.dev/github/shivamSspirit/S-Sol-tokens/blob/main/spltokens-sol-program/Anchor.toml)
2. second we paste in our solana program [lib.rs](http://lib.rs/) file

then again build and deploy the program to onchain
(these solana programs are upgradable after deployement)
