# Objective

In this lession, we go through the contents of this module, where we learn how to build a CPI enabled Flip program on Solidity.

## tl;dr

In the earlier modules, we covered topics like Solana programs, accounts, instructions, transactions, SPL tokens, and JSON RPC calls. In this module, we look into development techniques like Cross-Program Invocation, Program-Derived Addresses and Composability in Solana programs. 

# Overview

In previous modules, we built our foundational concepts by understanding how Solana's high-performance blockchain can get integrated with the familiar Solidity syntax. For practice, we learned how to build smart contracts and make fungible tokens.

In this module, we're going to explore a fascinating idea called **program composition** on Solana. We will also discuss Cross-Program Invocation, an advanced technique that allows different Solana programs to interact with each other. We will also go through development techniques like program-derived addresses (PDA). Our primary goal is to showcase Solana program composition using various program examples and coordinating many Solana programs.

By the end of this module, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of Solana programming's composability concept. We will explore how programs interact, share data, and collaborate, providing you with valuable insights into the Solana ecosystem.  To make things clearer, we'll handle business using Solana accounts to create sample programs that show these concepts

Before proceeding, it is recommended that you review the previous modules in this series. You can find them here: [solana-solang-guide](https://dev.to/shivamsspirit/minting-fungible-tokens-in-solana-using-solidity-solang-programming-language-50i6).
